This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

3. Run "make menuconfig" to select your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.

wnrmod2k name originates from my first modded router, Netgear WNR2000v3, which
has been equipped with replaceable SPI NOR flash (4M, 8M and 16M). Since then
this OpenWrt fork grew to include whole family of Atheros-based WNR models as
well as selected double-band WNDR boards.

Please visit my U-boot fork https://github.com/realmicu/uboot-wnrmod2k that
provides working bootloader for flash-modded WNR/WNDR routers and is a
prerequisite to use wnrmod2k OpenWrt branch.

Supported modded targets and models with config options are listed below.

* WNR2000v3 8M flash
  CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx_tiny_DEVICE_WNR2000V3_8M
